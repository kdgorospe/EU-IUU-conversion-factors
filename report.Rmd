## Introduction

High quality catch data is a pillar of fisheries management around the world. Catch data is central to enforcing quota systems and is a critical input to fisheries management models, both to understand the biomass removed from the population and as an indicator of the stock health. While stock assessments remain the gold standard for evaluating the sustainability of a fishery, full stock assessments are cost-prohibitive in many locations and at the frequency necessary. Catch data therefore remains a critical input piece of data for data-poor stock assessment and when paired with with fishing effort, serves as an indicator of catch sustainability (REF). [Point about FAO use of catch data] 

Illegal, unreported and underreported (IUU) fishing produces an underestimate of catch therefore distorting information on fish harvest relative to target sustainable levels and trends in catch used to understand stock sustainability. [General problem of IUU (define, describe magnitude, pathways and importance of traceability)]

Another key issue affecting the quality of catch data are live weight conversion factors. In general, the weight of fish caught is not measured directly. Instead, catch is typically estimated by multiplying the weight of fish landed, often after some amount of processing (e.g., removal of head or guts) that reduces the weight, by a "live weight conversion factor". For example, 1000 tonnes of landed fish with an associated live weight conversion factor of 1.2 would result in an estimated 1200 tonnes of catch. Converting landings to the live weight equivalent is necessary because patterns in landed weight will vary substantially with differences in processing prior to landing. The resulting live weight equivalent of the landed weight serves as the catch estimate reported in standard international databases. 

Noteably, seemingly small numerical differences in live weight conversion factors can result in large differences in estimated catch. For example, if we take the 1000 tonnes of landed fish from above and instead apply a live weight conversion factor of 1.8, we would estimate 1800 tonnes of catch, or an additional 600 tonnes. As discussed later in this report, live weight conversion factors for a single product can vary substantially more than in this example. Yet, despite the fact that applying different live weight conversion factors will substantially shift the estimated catch, live weight conversion factors are not generally reported alongside estimated catch. Further, once catch is aggregated by species or taxonomic group, the information on processing at landing is lost, making it impossible to reestimate catch using a different set of live weight conversion factors from the catch data alone. As a result unreporeted live weight conversion factors represent a set of critical underlying assumptions in catch data that inhibit data reproducibility and transparency. 
Further, this assumption [connection to IUU]

Following the FAO Coordinating Party on Fishery Statistics, within this report, the landed weight refers to the weight of product at the time of landing, regardless of the state (e.g., fresh or frozen) and presentation (e.g., whole, gutted, filleted, etc.), the product weight refers to the weight of a product at the time of weighing, and the nominal catch refers to the landings converted to a live weight basis (Ref: <http://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/capture-fisheries-statistics/catch-and-landings/en/>). Since fishery products can be landed in diverse states and presentations, which dramatically alter the weight, catch statistics are reported as nominal weight in international statistics. In order to convert from landed weight to nominal weight, a live weight conversion factor must be applied. The conversion to nominal weight enables better catch comparison across space and time since it incorporates differences in state and presentation. At the same time, the application of live weight conversion factors can introduce error when the factors do not accurately represent processing losses. Additionally, nominal catch only represents the live weight equivalent of the fishery products landed and therefore cannot be used to directly evaluate the gross catch, which includes not only the retained catch, but also the discarded catch. 

The EU catch certificate program aims to improve catch reporting to ... [add goals of catch certificate program]. To improve the catch reporting, the Commission implementing regulation (EU) No 404/2011 outlines which live weight conversion factors should be used for catch landed in or exported to the EU. For landings by Regional Fisheries Management Organizations, of which the EU is a Contracting party or cooperating non-Contracting party, or in areas where the EU has an agreement to fish in third country waters, the conversion factors defined by the Regional Fisheries Management Organization or third-party nation apply. Otherwise, the conversion factors set by the EU are to be used when available. In cases where no EU or regional conversion factors exist for a given species and presentation, the conversion factor adopted by the flag Member State applies. Finally, imported seafood products are subject to a separate set of issues related to live weight conversion factors, stemming from both the different potential set of conversion factors and the fact that the EU cannot generally require non-EU countries to use the conversion factors set by the EU.

## Methods

### Data

*Live weight conversion factors*

Live weight conversion factors for this analysis were compiled from four sources. First, the official EU-wide live weight conversion factors for fresh, salted, and frozen products were recorded from the European Commission's Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 Annexes XIII, XIV, and IV, respectively. Second, Member State live weight conversion factors were recorded from the European Commission's EU fishery control system Table 2 (<https://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/control/conversion_factors_en>). The Member State live weight conversion factors refer only to quota species. Therefore, we also included live weight conversion factor data from the Food and Agriculture Organization to expand the data coverage and to include values for non-EU countries. Finally, we compiled conversion factors from the national fisheries authorities of the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Norway (i.e., "third countries" that follow certain EU fishery regulations, but are not part of the EU: https://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/control/conversion_factors_en)

*Landings data*

Landings data of all fishery products landed in the ports of European Economic Area (EEA) countries come from Eurostat's online database (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database). While both quantity (tonnes) and value (Euro) are reported, we focus on quantity for this report since we are able to use conversion factors to backcalculate nominal catch. On the other hand, we are unaware of any analogous conversion factor that we could apply to the landings value in order to get the original value of the unprocessed catch. 

Landing quantities also report various states (e.g., Fresh, Salted, Dried, etc.) as well as presentations (e.g., Whole, Fillet, Gutted, etc.), which are relevant for matching landings data to the appropriate conversion factors. Landings quantities are reported annually. When we present time series data, we show the full range of available data from 1992 to 2018. In some cases, we only present a snapshot of the data (e.g., when we compare the national vs EU-wide conversion factor for a single species' state and presentation). For these snapshots, we present the most recent year available for each case study, and no earlier than 2016.

*Trade data*

[I took a stab at this] For the trade case study, we use the United Nations' Comtrade BACI data (a standardized international trade database) to provide an example of how the variability in conversion factors is exacerbated when dealing with internationally traded products. We focus on the import of frozen mackerel from South Korea into the European Union. This product is officially catalogued in the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) as HS code 030354. All products with this code number fall under the description "frozen, mackerel (scomber scombrus, scomber australasicus, scomber japonicus), excluding fillets, livers, roes, and other fish meat." The problem of different countries having different conversion factors for a given species product form, is compounded by the fact that the HS codes by which internationally traded products are reported also contain multiple species. Products entering the European Eunion with HS code 030354 therefore may be matched to different conversion factors based not only on country variability but also species variability. 

### Analysis

Landed weight must be multiplied by the corresponding live weight conversion factor in order to estimate the pre-processing weight of the catch (i.e., the live weight equivalent). The live weight conversion factor can have a large impact on the estimated catch and it is therefore important that the landed weight be matched to the appropriate live weight conversion factor, based on the species, presentation and state of the landed product (Figure 1). 

![Figure 1: Illustration of estimated live weight equivalent of catch for different presentations and ranges of live weight conversion factors](Images/LWE_calc_fig.png)

The objective of the analysis is to illustrate the impact of different live weight conversion factors on calculated catch using case study examples. The case studies were selected to illustrate 1) the differences in the application of EU-wide versus Member State values and the range in values across the EU; 2) the differences in the application of EU versus non-EU conversion factors, and; 3) the additional challenges with the application of conversion factors to trade data. Case studies were selected on the basis of there being a wide range in the reported live weight conversion factors. Additionally, live weight conversion factors had to match available landings data for countries being compared.

In the first step, we evaluated the ranges in live weight conversion factors and coverage of live weight conversion factors at the EU and Member State levels. To do this, we matched conversion factors by species, presentation and state. We then calculated the range in conversion factors for each species-presentation-state, in both absolute ($max-min$) and relative ($max/min$) terms [Kelvin- I think we should add the relative change too]. The absolute difference indicates the range in values that may be applied, while the relative difference indicates the potential extent of impact on the calculated catch. For example, take one product with conversion factors ranging from 3.0-4.5 and a second ranging from 1.0-2.0. The first has a wider range of live weight conversion factors (1.5 compared to 1.0) while the second has a larger relative difference (1.5 compared to 2.0). In this example, 100 tonnes of product would mean an estimated catch of 300-450 tonnes in the first case, but 100-200 tonnes in the second case. We then plotted these ranges, identifying within the plots which points represent EU-wide, EU Member State, and non-EU values. 

Comparing catch estimates resulting from applying different live weight conversion factors requires not only a range of reported live weight conversion factors, but also that the live weight conversion factors are provided by the countries landing the product (not only for the species, but also the correct presentation and state). Therefore, we evaluated the coverage of conversion factors throughout the EU. To do this, we calculated the proportion of countries that report landings of a given product that also report a live weight conversion factor. We then also identify which products landed within the EU have an EU-wide conversion factor. 

Once the conversion factor data were matched to landings data, we were able to identify candidate case studies based on the range of relevant conversion factors and the volume of landings. These selection criteria enable illustration of large differences in estimated catch volume based on real landings and alternate live weight conversion factor data.

## Live weight conversion factor ranges and data coverage

[Discuss with Kelvin which figures to include here - If it can fit on a single page, I think we should include the full figure of all conversion factors based on relative ranges. If this doesn't fit (or if the text is too small), we can just report the top 100 or whatever can fit, and include a note saying that we are also providing them with the raw data as a CSV file. I decided to remove the "source" (i.e., FAO vs European Commission vs Third Country Info) from the plots but I can add it back in if you think it's important. ]

We draw from our database of conversion factors from FA

## Data Availability:
When considering just the official conversion factors implemented by the European Commission's Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 for EU-wide and Member State fisheries products, and merge this with all products landed by fishing vessels from the 27 EU countries, we see considerable data gaps that hinder our (and the EU's) ability to calculate nominal match for these landed products.

## Catch Statistic Terminology

[Add in notes from email exchange]

Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, houses the catch data within the Agriculture and fisheries division. Eurostat is a member organization of the Coordinating Working Party on Fishery Statistics (CWP) and therefore has adopted the CWP catch statistic concepts and definitions. Therefore, here we compare the terminoligy on the EU catch certificate to the CWP terminology. 

As described above, catch statistics are reported as the live weight equivalent, which differs from... The CWP defines are nominal catch, landed weight, product weight, and discards. 

The European Union Catch Certificate includes fields for reporting catch, transhipment, and import weight: 

* Catch - Estimated live weight (net fish weight in kg) (Fig _)
* Catch - Estimated live weight to be landed (net fish weight in kg) (Fig _)
* Catch - Verified Weight Landed (net weight in kg) (Fig _)
* Transhipment - Estimated weight (kg) (Fig _)
* Import - Net weight in kg (Fig _)
* Import - Net fish weight in kg (Fig _)

Within the CWP, net weight refers to the landed weight, not the nominal catch. The EU catch certificate fields "Estimated live weight" and "Estimated live weight to be landed" include estimated live weight (nominal catch) in the main field name, but specify "net fish weight in kg" in the parentheses. 

Check if estimated live weigh includes discards

FIXIT: Check that these forms are the correct forms corresponding to the Commission implementing regulation (EU) No 404/2011

States "The fish live weight shall be obtained by multiplying the fish processed weight by the conversion factors referred to in Article 49 of this Regulation for each species and presentation." but the term "fish processed weight" is not the same term used on the catch certificate.

## Recommendations for Harmonizing Catch Statistics

* For data reproducibility:
* Landings certificate should collect CF values. This is especially important in the cases of multiple presentations, where it would be very difficult to guess the CF applied ("In case of collective presentations, only one conversion factor corresponding to one of the parts of the collective presentation of a fish shall be used.")
* CF values applied to back-calculate live weight should be reported with the catch data (currently unable to back-calculate CF values from historical catch and landings because fish are landed in multiple presentations which can't be paired back to total catch which does not record original landed presentations)
* Alternatively, catch data should report original landed presentation, and from this one could back-calculate the applied CF value
* Need for EU-wide CF for all species/presentations -- there are cases where a country says to use the EU wide value for a species, but the EU does not provide a value for all states/presentations
* Mismatch between landings data states and presentations. Need better definitions for the states and presentations. Not fully hierarchical, salted appears as a state and a presentation, and some states (e.g., cooked) don't appear on the state code list at all
